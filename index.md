## Welcome

I am an assistant professor of economics at the University of Oregon. My research fields are environmental and resource economics, with particular interests in climate, energy, water and fisheries.

My work is mostly applied and uses a mix of traditional econometrics, Bayesian methods, GIS, and (increasingly) newer data science tools like machine learning.

Please feel free to contact me at the links provided on this website, or at the following address: Department of Economics, 1285 University of Oregon, Eugene, OR 97403-1285, USA
