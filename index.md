I am an assistant professor of economics at the University of Oregon. My research fields are environmental and resource economics, with particular interests in climate, energy, water, and fisheries.

My work is mostly applied and uses a mix of classical econometrics, Bayesian methods, GIS, and (increasingly) newer data science tools like machine learning. Broadly speaking, I am interested in questions like: How do changes in environmental conditions affect the economy, and vice versa? How should societies manage their natural resources when they are faced with uncertainty, and how does this behaviour change if new information becomes available? And, do environmental policies function as intended, or are there unexpected consequences?

Please feel free to contact me at the links provided on this website, or at the following address: Department of Economics, 1285 University of Oregon, Eugene, OR 97403-1285, USA
