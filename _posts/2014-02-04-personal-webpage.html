I have a new personal webpage up:&nbsp;<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/grantmcdermott/">https://sites.google.com/site/grantmcdermott/</a><br /><br />This will act as a repository for all of my research and academic activities. It is still quite a while before I have to go on the job market (if indeed that happens to be the route I pursue). However, I prefer to have something up and running well in advance.<br /><br />I should also say that this new webpage isn't intended as a replacement for Stickman's Corral. I'll likely continue using Stickman's as a platform for all of my blog musings... at least for the foreseeable future. That said, I'd welcome any comments and feedback from regular readers! (And, yes, I realise that I'll probably have to trim the "bio" section before any serious interviews.)
