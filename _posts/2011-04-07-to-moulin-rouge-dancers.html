That little beauty of a subject line is the title of an email that I received today. The message itself reads:<br /><blockquote><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: blue;">Dear [XXX]</span></blockquote><blockquote><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: blue;">You all were FANTASTIC on Saturday night!!! &nbsp;I can't thank you enough<br />for the time, passion and artistry you contributed to the evening! &nbsp;It was<br />so thrilling to see how you all transformed [XXX] into the Moulin Rouge.&nbsp;</span></blockquote><blockquote><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: blue;">Your energy and joy filled the room every time you entered.&nbsp;</span></blockquote><blockquote><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: blue;">Thank you, thank you, thank you!!!</span></blockquote>Well, it's certainly not every day that I get such a glowing review.<br /><br />Alas, I cannot claim this one.&nbsp;I actually get these emails fairly often as my name (and hence email address) is very similar to someone apparently heavily involved in Boston's amateur theatre scene.<br /><br />I used to send my apologies and explain the case of mistaken identity... But as it kept happening, I've since just decided to embrace it. At least this way I get to keep tabs on what's happening in Massachusetts&nbsp;art house scene.<br /><br />To my (almost) namesake, whoever you are: Keep up the good work!<br /><br /><s>Lady Marmalade</s><br />o-[-&lt;
