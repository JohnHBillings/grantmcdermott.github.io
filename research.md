## Working papers

"Sceptic priors and climate policy."

*How much evidence would it take to convince climate sceptics that they are wrong about global warming? I explore this question within a Bayesian framework. I consider a group of stylised sceptics and examine how these individuals update their beliefs in the face of current and continuing climate change. I find that available evidence in the form of instrumental climate data already tends to overwhelm all but the most extreme priors. The resulting posterior distributions of climate sensitivity correspond closely to existing estimates from the scientific literature. The updated beliefs of most sceptics are thus consistent with a carbon price that is substantially greater than zero. However, belief convergence is a non-linear function of prior strength, so that it become increasingly difficult to convince the marginal sceptic. I conclude by discussing the general conditions for consensus formation under Bayesian learning, its relevance to our current policy impasse, and offer some remarks about finding common ground in the future.* ([Link to paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6AgOxtQA9dTcjRmZkNjMVhuVFU/view?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"}.

"Hydro power. Market might."

*A central tenant of economic theory is that market power induces deadweight loss to society as dominant firms restrict output. However, evidence of such restrictive behaviour by real-world firms is notoriously difficult to establish. This paper provides direct evidence of Norwegian electricity firms withholding production as they gain prominence in local markets. The research design exploits exogenous variation in the formation of local electricity markets due to binding transmission constraints. The ubiquity of hydropower generation in these markets further allows me to abstract from empirical complications associated with marginal cost estimation and variations in the fuel supply mix.	Combining these features with a novel data set of hydropower reservoirs, plants and electricity flows --- encompassing 90 percent of the system capacity ---  I show that an increase in local market power causes firms to withhold production during periods with relatively inelastic demand. A larger takeaway is that even our most advanced markets may be susceptible to price manipulation and welfare losses under relatively common conditions.* (New version available soon.)<!--([Link to paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6AgOxtQA9dTaWcxdHpsNE5wdjA/view?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"}.)-->

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
   <i>Hydropower is the world's foremost source of non-fossil fuel energy. It is also characterised by a unique set of production features that have the potential to greatly simplify economic questions related to firm behaviour and output. I exploit these characteristics, together with plant-level data and exogenous variation in market power, to identify evidence of noncompetitive behaviour in the Nordic electricity sector. Consistent with economic theory, I show that increased market power causes firms to withhold production during inelastic demand periods, thereby yielding higher profits and driving up consumer prices. The larger takeaway is that even our most advanced markets are susceptible to price distortions and welfare losses under fairly common conditions.</i>

## Selected works in progress

"The value of *bulk information* in the age of search engines." With Christopher J. Costello and Michael B. Ward.

<!--
*A broad class of economic decision problems involves searching over a collection of uncertain research leads. Existing search theory informs the efficient search over this pool using available information. But in many cases, the researcher has the opportunity to collect new information en masse, e.g. with a search engine or scientific framework, that will benefit the search. We derive the value of this type of bulk information, determine the general properties that render it large or small, and calculate its implications for economic innovation. We show that changes to the underlying characteristics of different search problems can yield surprising results. For example, more lucrative end-prizes can actually reduce the value of information, while the possibility of better information often suppresses innovation.*
