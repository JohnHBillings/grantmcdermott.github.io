"Sceptic priors and climate policy"
Abstract: How much evidence would it take to convince climate sceptics that they are wrong about global warming? I explore this question within a Bayesian framework. I consider a group of stylised sceptics and examine how these individuals update their beliefs in light of the available evidence for climate change. I find that all but the most extreme priors are overwhelmed by the historical data. The resulting posterior distributions of climate sensitivity correspond closely to existing estimates from the literature. I show further that the updated sceptic beliefs are consistent with a social cost of carbon that is substantially greater than zero. I conclude by discussing the general conditions for consensus formation under Bayesian learning, its relevance to our current policy impasse, and offer some remarks about finding common ground in the future.

##Works in progress##

"Market might. Hydro power."
Abstract: I test for evidence of strategic behaviour in the Norwegian electricity sector using a uniquely detailed dataset of hydropower reservoirs. Consistent with theory, I find that market power leads to an intertemporal reallocation of water resources across periods. An increase in market power causes firms to withhold production when demand is at its most inelastic. This would permit dominant firms to recoup higher profits while consumers are least responsive to price changes. The effects are modest next to other factors governing reservoir management, such as annual snow-melt. Yet, they may still cause the production profile of hydropower firms to diverge in meaningful ways if the differences in market share are large enough, and particularly when regional transmission constraints are binding.
