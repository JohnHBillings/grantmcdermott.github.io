## Working papers

#### Protecting marine mammals, turtles and birds by rebuilding global fisheries

Revised and resubmitted, *Science*. With Matthew G. Burgess and others.

*Reductions in global fishing pressure are needed to end overfishing of target species and maximize the value of fisheries. We ask whether such reductions would also be sufficient to protect non-target species threatened as bycatch. We compare changes in fishing pressure needed to maximize profits from 4,713 target fish stocks—accounting for &gt;75% of global catch—to changes in fishing pressure needed to reverse ongoing declines of 20 marine mammal, sea turtle, and seabird populations threatened by bycatch. We project that maximizing fishery profits would halt or reverse declines of approximately half of these threatened populations. Recovering the other populations would require substantially greater effort reductions or targeting improvements. Improving commercial fishery management could thus yield important collateral benefits for threatened bycatch species globally.*

#### [Sceptic priors and climate policy](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6AgOxtQA9dTcjRmZkNjMVhuVFU/view?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"}

Under review.

*How much evidence would it take to convince climate sceptics that they are wrong about global warming? I explore this question within a Bayesian framework. I consider a group of stylised sceptics and examine how these individuals update their beliefs in the face of current and continuing climate change. I find that available evidence in the form of instrumental climate data already tends to overwhelm all but the most extreme priors. The resulting posterior distributions of climate sensitivity correspond closely to existing estimates from the scientific literature. The updated beliefs of most sceptics are thus consistent with a carbon price that is substantially greater than zero. However, belief convergence is a non-linear function of prior strength, so that it become increasingly difficult to convince the marginal sceptic. I conclude by discussing the general conditions for consensus formation under Bayesian learning, its relevance to our current policy impasse, and offer some remarks about finding common ground in the future.* ([Link to paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6AgOxtQA9dTcjRmZkNjMVhuVFU/view?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"}.

#### [Hydro power. Market might.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6AgOxtQA9dTaWcxdHpsNE5wdjA/view?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"}

*Hydropower is the world's foremost source of non-fossil fuel energy. It is also characterised by a unique set of production features that greatly simplify economic questions related to firm behaviour and output. Here I exploit these characteristics, together with quasi-experimental variation in market power and rich firm-level data, to identify evidence of noncompetitive behaviour in the Nordic electricity market. Consistent with theory, I find that increased market power leads to a dynamic pattern of resource shifting. Dominant firms tend to withhold production during inelastic demand periods, which would enable them to secure higher profits. My results suggest that even our most advanced electricity markets may be susceptible to manipulation under relatively common conditions.* ([Link to paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6AgOxtQA9dTaWcxdHpsNE5wdjA/view?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"}.

## Works in progress

#### The value of *bulk information* in the age of search engines

With Christopher J. Costello and Michael B. Ward.

*A broad class of economic decision problems involves searching over a collection of uncertain research leads. Existing search theory informs the efficient search over this pool using available information. But in many cases, the researcher has the opportunity to collect new information en masse, e.g. with a search engine or scientific framework, that will benefit the search. We derive the value of this type of bulk information, determine the general properties that render it large or small, and calculate its implications for economic innovation. We show that changes to the underlying characteristics of different search problems can yield surprising results. For example, more lucrative end-prizes can actually reduce the value of information, while the possibility of better information often suppresses innovation.*

#### The blue paradox: Preemptive overfishing in marine protected areas

With Christopher J. Costello and Kyle C. Meng.

*More information coming soon.*
